### Hello world! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my page!

### Currently......

I am a second-year master's student at Texas Tech University. I am working on a thesis project to determine how thermodynamic
variables change across fronts in different seasons and regions, and how well models capture this change. I also worked
on a project this summer which helped quantify the impact of soil moisture on maximum daily temperature. 

### In the past....

I worked on a project as an undergraduate to classify and analyze different overlapping tornado and flash flood warnings (TORFFs).
